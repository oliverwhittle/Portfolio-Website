      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I've been coding since I was 11, starting with small projects and eventually building larger web apps.</p>
      <p>I'm primarily a front-end developer who enjoys crafting responsive, accessible, and interactive UIs.</p>
      <p>In my free time, I like to design and build indie video games - especially pixel art and 2D platformers.</p>
      <p>When I'm not coding, I'm usually playing badminton or hitting the golf course.</p>
